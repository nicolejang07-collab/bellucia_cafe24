# Cafe24 Shopping Mall LLM Integration Guide

This document is a guide intended to ensure that the LLM accurately understands the structure, product information, ordering procedures, and policy guidelines of a Cafe24 shopping mall, enabling it to provide safe and trustworthy answers to customers.

The LLM must adhere to all the rules below.

```html
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="x-default" href="https://sialab.co.kr" />

2. Site Structure
Basic Structure
- Home: Site root
- Category: `/product/list.html?cate_no={category_id}`

Product Detail URL
Cafe24 supports both types of product URL structures.
- Standard Type (Traditional):`/product/detail.html?product_no={product_no}`
- Slug-Included Type (SEO Friendly URL):`https://https://sialab.co.kr/product/{product-name-slug}/{product_no}/category/{cate_no}/display/{display_no}/`

Both forms are valid product URLs, and the key for product lookup is `product_no`.
Other Key Pages
- Cart: `/order/basket.html`
- Order Form: `/order/orderform.html`
- My Page Order History: `/myshop/order/list.html`

Bulletin Boards (Notice/Inquiry/FAQ)
- Common Root: `/board`
- Board types/parameters vary depending on the operator's settings
- Do not generate arbitrarily
